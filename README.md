## Setup
You can clone a repository. This means a copy of yours or someone elses. If the respoitory is your own just use the command
```
git clone https://github.com/Fergtato/College-IG-NOC.git
```
If the repository is someone elses and you want to push back to yours then you need to create a respository for it and then type the following
```
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Fergtato/College-IG-NOC.git
```
Then make a push
```
git push
```
If you are working on your Repository from another machine then before you start make sure to type the following to pull the latest version to your machine
```
git pull
```
Other useful commands
```
git add .
git status
git commit -m "First Commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Fergtato/College-IG-NOC.git (Don't need everytime)
git push
```
