# Point A to Point B

Making a mover move from one point to another at a certain speed.

## The Code

Declare the starting x position and the xSpeed.

```js
var x = 320;
var xspeed = 2;
```

Increment the x position by the defined speed.

```js
x = x + xspeed;
```

The mover's x position increments at a speed of 2 to the right.
